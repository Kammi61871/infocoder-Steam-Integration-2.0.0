SteamAuth for Xenforo2
It's a fork from https://github.com/NixFifty/XenForo2-SteamIntegration and modified by https://infocoder.su/resources/steam-integration.137/


Attention!
The sources of the add-on are taken from the open repository - GitHub: NixFifty / XenForo2-SteamIntegration and are collected in the finished add-on (some inaccuracies have been fixed, the button's styling is added), since the author has not yet published or released, there may be errors, fear and risk.
Although before the publication, the add-on was tested and the integration worked without criticism.

After installing this add-on, your new users will be able to register on your forum using their Steam account, and existing users will be able to associate their accounts with their Steam accounts.
